![Screenshot of MobileSim with three robots](MobileSim_screenshot.png)

MobileSim is software for simulating mobile robots and their environments,
for debugging and experimentation with [ARIA][aria]
or other software that supports Adept MobileRobots platforms.

MobileSim is based on the Stage library, created by the [Player/Stage project][ps].
Stage and MobileSim are free software, distributed under the terms of the GNU 
General Public License: see [the full license](LICENSE.txt) for details.

MobileSim converts a MobileRobots/ActivMedia map (a .map file, 
created by Mapper3&trade;, Mapper3-Basic, or other means) to a Stage 
environment, and places a simulated robot model in that 
environment.  It then provides a simulated Pioneer control 
connection accessible via a TCP port (similar to the real 
Pioneer's serial port connection).  ARIA is able to connect
to TCP ports instead of serial ports (ArRobotConnector, for example,
automatically tries TCP port 8101 before the serial port).

MobileSim (powered by Stage) has the following features
and device models. Device model parameters may be customized in a
configuration file, or new models may be defined based on existing
models.
 
* Various models of MobileRobots/ActivMedia differential drive
    mobile robot bases (Pioneer 3 DX and AT, PowerBot&trade;, AmigoBot&trade;,
    PeopleBot&trade;, PatrolBot&reg;, Seekur&reg;, Pioneer 2, Pioneer 1).
* You can define custom models of differential drive or 
    omnidirectional robots, laser and sonar, defined either as
    a Stage model definition, or by loading an Aria parameter (.p)
    file.
* Sonar range sensor model
* Laser range sensor (SICK LMS-200) model
* Robot odometry pose estimation (with cumulative error)
* Multiple robots (good performance is possible on a fast computer with
  more than 25 robots)
* Evironment and obstacles are loaded from a
  MobileRobots/ActivMedia/ARIA map file; use the same map with ARNL/SONARNL or
  your own software.
* Interactively move robots and obstacles (with customized map file, see below)
* Objects (robots or obstactles) may be configured to be detectable
    only by some sensors
* Objects (robots or obstacles) may be set as "highly reflective"
    for special detection by the laser range sensor
* Save image "snapshot" of simulation or save a sequence of images
    for making movies.
* Map files may be reloaded at run time
* Robots may be interactively repositioned through the GUI or by
    a command from client software
* Client software may send log messages to MobileSim. Log messages
    are timestamped and displayed both the GUI and console or log file, with
    optional HTML formatting.
* Visualization options for sensors, robots and obstacles, such as
    drawing robot "trails" to show history of motion, color, diagnostic
    values/visualization, and visualizations for debugging the simulator
    itself.
* Configurable space and time resolutions.
* Full source code included under the GPL for understanding 
    the simulation implementation, customizing and improving it,
    or even adapting MobileSim's ARIA communication protocol layer for
    other simulators.

Installation
------------

To install MobileSim on Windows, run the executable self-installer.

To install MobileSim from either the RPM or Debian (deb) package,
use your system's appropriate installation tool (`rpm` on RedHat,
SuSe, etc. and 
`dpkg` or Synaptic ("Add downloaded packages") on Debian, Ubuntu,
etc.).  The RPM was built on RedHat 7.3, and the Debian
package was built on Debian 3.1 (sarge) for i386 (32-bit). MobileSim requires the GTK 2.0+
libraries on RedHat, and GTK 2.6+ on Debian.  It also requires libstdc++ 2.2 for 
libc6. (These libraries are standard parts of most Linux installations, but if 
they are missing you may have to install packages which provide them).
If you are running amd64 or ia64 Debian, try installing the
`ia32-libs-gtk` and
`ia32-libs` packages using `apt-get`, and then installing the MobileSim package with the
`--force-architecture` option to `dpkg`.

To build MobileSim from source code, obtain the "MobileSim-src" tar/gz archive
from [http://robots.mobilerobots.com/wiki/MobileSim][webpage]
and follow the instructions in the README.src.text file found inside.

How to get started
------------------

To simulate a robot you need a map file containing lines for walls. A map 
file with lines can be created using a recent version of Mapper3 
or Mapper3-Basic (See [robots.mobilerobots.com][site]) or by other means.
See the [ARIA Reference Documentation](../Aria/docs/index.html)
for the
`ArMap` class for a full description of the format,
or refer to `columbia.map` or `AMROffice.map`, distributed with MobileSim,
for an example.

MobileSim may be launched from the Start menu (Windows), or from the 
Gnome or KDE menu (Linux), or from the command line (any platform).

Run MobileSim from a command line prompt like this:

    MobileSim

or, to skip the initial dialog by specifying a map file and robot model
to create on the command line:

    MobileSim -m *<map file>* -r *<robot model>*

For example:

    MobileSim -m columbia.map -r p3dx

The parameters are optional. The default robot model created, if -r is not
given, is "p3dx".  Some additional robot models include "p3at", 
"powerbot", "peoplebot", "patrolbot-sh", "seekur", and "amigo". 

To create multiple simulated robots, use -r multiple times, naming 
the robots after the model type, seperated by a colon, if you wish:

     MobileSim -m columbia.map -r p3dx:robot1 -r p3dx:robot2 -r amigo:robot3

If you are working with many robots, it can be inconvenient to create them
all at MobileSim startup.  If you use -R instead of -r, then a new robot
will be created on demand for each client that connects, and destroyed
when the client exits. (So the robot's state is not preserved.)

More command-line options are described below.

If you run MobileSim with no command line options, or from the desktop menu, 
you may select the map and one robot model from a dialog box.  Or, you may 
choose to use no map (but note that in this case, the usable universe
is limited to 200 x 200 meters -- gray area indicates the edge.)

Example maps are included with MobileSim. On Linux, you can find these
files by navigating from the root file system to
`/usr/local/MobileSim`.
On Windows, these maps are in `C:\Program
Files\MobileRobots\MobileSim`.
`columbia.map` included with MobileSim is equivalent to
`columbia.map`
included with ARNL.

A window will appear, displaying your map environment and robot(s). The
robot will start at a home position in your map, if present, or at the center
of the map. The robot's body is drawn based on the aproximate length and 
width -- including wheels -- of the model selected.  You can pan in 
the window by holding down the right mouse button, or mouse button with
the Shift or Control key and dragging. You can zoom 
with the mouse scroll wheel, or by holding down the middle mouse button 
or left mouse button with the Alt or Option key, and dragging towards or away from 
the center of the circle that appears.   

The robot may be moved by dragging it with the left mouse button and rotated by
dragging it with the right mouse button, or while holding down the Shift or Control 
key. Note that this will update the robot's 
true pose, but *not* its odometry -- it is like picking up the robot 
off the ground and carrying it to a new location.

You can turn on device visualizations using the View menu. Ranger or 
Sonar: if a client program has connected and enabled the sonar, sonar 
field centers will be drawn as grey lines. Laser: If a client program 
has enabled the laser rangefinder, its range will be drawn as a light 
blue field.  Position: Axes are drawn for the robot's odometry 
coordinate system, and its true pose, odometric pose, and current 
velocity are displayed.

A snapshot or sequence of snapshots of the window can be saved as a 
bitmap file to disk with the Export item in the File menu.

The lower log message pane displays information and warning about what 
the robots are doing (some commands will result in a log message, but 
not all).  `SIM_MESSAGE` commands also display messages here.
The statusbar pane below the log message pane displays, from left to right: 
the total time since the simulator started; the ratio of real time per
update step and simulation time, indicating how close to real-time (1.0) the
simulation is running; the total number of "subscriptions" in the simulation
(one per each robot plus one per each device being accessed); and the MobileSim 
and stage version numbers.


Once running, a program can connect to the simulator
via TCP port 8101, and use the same protocol on that TCP port as it does with
a real robot over its serial port link.  Any ARIA-based program that uses 
ArRobotConnector or ArTcpConnection will do this automatically. You can 
specify an alternate port number with the -p option.   If multiple robots were 
requested with multiple -r options, each additional robot will use the next 
port number (i.e. 8102, 8103, etc.). For these additional robots, you will
have to specify the port number when running its ARIA program, usually using
the -rrtp (-remoteRobotTcpPort) command-line option.

A tool called `convertBitmapToArMap` is available in the ARIA
utilities and in the MobileSim source code to convert a PNM format
bitmap image to an ArMap .map file.  On Linux, first install libnetpbm::

  sudo apt-get install libnetpbm

Then you can build convertBitmapToArMap using make:

  make convertBitmapToArMap

Run with `-help` for info:

  ./convertBitmapToArMap --help

A tool called `convertSfWorldToMap` is also available in ARIA's collection of 
utility and example programs to convert a Saphira .wld file to a .map, as well as a 
tool called `addSfWorldLinesToMap` for importing lines into a .map
from a .wld.  



Notes, Limitations, and Future Plans
------------------------------------

The goal of Stage and MobileSim are to provide an efficient and sufficient
simulation of multiple robots. While we have modified Stage to add some
features and additional behavior (such as basic sensor noise), the simulation remains
simplified.
Don't forget to test your code on a real robot.  See below for notes on
the internal simulation mechanism and robot and sensor models.

> "All models are wrong. Some are useful." --George E. P. Box

However, since the full source code for MobileSim and Stage are
available (in the "MobileSim-src" package available from the [MobileSim
webpage][webpage]),
it is always possible to add new models or modify existing
models to simulate any particular properties you need.  Stage is
not hard to understand and modify.  If you need any help, ask
on the aria-users mailing list, or the Player/Stage mailing list.
If you do make any modifications that you think others would 
find useful, you may post them to aria-users, or send them to
support@mobilerobots.com.

#### A note about data communications channels

On a real robot, ARIA may be communicating with different devices over separate
communications channels. For example, ARIA communicates with the robot
microcontroller over one RS-232 serial port, with a SICK LMS-200 laser
rangefinder over a different RS-232 serial port, simultaneously using two
different threads (one contained in ArRobot, the other in ArLMS200 which is a
subclass of ArThreadedRangeDevice).  Other additional devices may use additional
parallel communications channels such as serial, USB and ethernet connections.  

However, ARIA communicates with MobileSim over only one TCP socket connection.
Therefore all communications with both the simulated robot and simulated devices
must occur on this one channel, the same channel as the robot connection. ARIA's 
Connector classes detect MobileSim and
use the appropriate code to handle data transfer with devices via the original
"robot" TCP connection to MobileSim.
Be aware of this when structuring programs; for example, laser
data will not be received unless the ArRobot connection is active and running
(using either `ArRobot::runAsync()` or `ArRobot::run()`).


#### Additional notes:

* See below for details on supported commands and specific known problems 
with the ARCOS/AROS/P2OS command emulation.
* Sonar reflection is not modeled
* Several devices are not available yet, including grippers, arms, 
general pan-tilt units, IR sensors, bumpers, analog or digital 
I/O ports, or video cameras.
* MobileSim is somewhat graphics intensive and may compete with e.g. MobileEyes
for graphics resources, especially on older computers, VMs, or other systems with
limited graphics resources. Graphics display is not fully optimized yet.
* While it is possible to make the simulation run faster (or much slower)
than near "real time", it is not well tested how this affects clients. 
Many clients (including those using ARIA) have timeout limits based on
the real system time (it is possible to configure most of ARIA's timeout
limits, though. See reference documentation or ask the aria-users group).  
Clients also may not be able to process packets fast
enough if the simulation runs much faster than real time, resulting in 
buffering of data and possibly loss of data.
  


Future plans for include better sonar model, simulating additional
devices, and various user interface features for creating new simulated 
robots, loading maps, and tweaking their properties.  If you have any 
requests or would like to help add features, please join the discussion 
on the aria-users mailing list.  


Internal Simulation Mechanism and Models
----------------------------------------

The simulation loop attempts to run at a fixed real-world time interval,
corresponding to a fixed simulated-world time interval.  In most cases, each
simulated time interval would ideally equal the real (system) time taken to
perform that interval.  This ratio is monitored and a short running average is 
displayed in the bottom of the MobileSim GUI window, and is also available from
the `SIM_STAT` packet.  It should normally be at or close to 1.0 most of the time. 
(The desired ratio can be
adjusted, but will cause problems with most software).

At each iteration, the Stage simulation engine checks for GUI input (if GUI is
enabled), then updates state of each
simulated robot, sensor, and other device in the simulation -- it is at
this stage that the robot is moved if moving, the environment is searched
to determine sensor readings, etc. (See below for some deatils.) 
 Then the GUI display (if enabled) is updated.  The simulation update interval is
configurable.  The default rate is 100ms. 

Client communications are also done at a given interval (100ms by
default). For each robot, data is sent if a client is connected to that robot,
according to the Pioneer protocol.  This includes its odometric position
estimate, miscellaneous state, and, if enabled, simulated sonar and laser data.  
Commands are read from the client software (if any were sent), and stored for
the appropriate Stage device model to handle in the next iteration of the 
simulation loop.

Each robot, and each sensor or other device on each robot, is simulated by a
`model` object.  The code for these models can be found in the `stage/src`
subdirectory of the MobileSim source code.  

#### Simulation environment

The contents of the simulated world are read from a map file (ArMap format,
same as used by Mapper3 and other AMR software).    The ArMap file contains
obstacle data given as points and/or lines which will be sensable by all
sensors, and with which robots can also collide.   It is also possible to
represent simple shapes in the map file which will only be present in the
simulator (and are not used by ARNL for localization or planning). These
objects may be configured as visible or invisible to different sensor types, and 
as subject to collisions by other models (i.e. robots) or not.  See below for
details.

In addition, the shape of all simulated robot models are also present in the
environment, and subject to collision and sensing by other robots.

The simulation environment is represented with a minimum resolution, which is by
default 2 cm.  (This can be adjusted with the `--resolution` command-line
argument, see below for details.)

#### position model, a movable robot


A mobile robot that can move within the world. The robot may be
differential-drive (two degrees of freedom, capable of translational and rotational motion), or
omnidirectional (three degrees of freedom, capable of translational, lateral or
rotational motion).   Motion can be commanded via desired velocities in each
axis (velocity control, from `VEL`, `TRANSVEL`, and `RVEL` comands), or discrete changes in position may be commanded 
relative-position control from `MOVE` and `DHEAD` commands, or absolute heading
from `HEAD` command).  In addition, clients can request artifically
dropping the robot at any new position in the world.   

The code implementing the position model can be found in the MobileSim source
code in `stage/src/model_position.c`.

At each simulation loop, the position model is updated according to the most
recently received velocity commands.   Velocity is controlled on three independent
axes: translation (robot local X), lateral translation (robot local Y,
non-differential drive robots only) and rotation (robot local Theta).
The position model determines the currently desired velocities on each axis
of motion (X, Y (seekur robot only), and Theta).  This is clamped according to 
previously set maximum speed parameters.   Previously set acceleration or
deceleration parameters and the duration of the simulated loop iteration are 
then used to determine an increased or decreased
velocity from the robot's current velocity, and a potential new position is
projected from the current position using these velocities. This is followed
by collision checking, and then an update of the simulated odometric pose
estimate.

If a relative distance translation (`MOVE`) command is active, then a velocity
proportional to the remaining distance and the configured maximum velocity is
used.  If the robot has already moved the commanded move distance however, then desired
velocity is set to 0.   The desired velocity will later be limited according
to maximum speed configured.

If a translation velocity command (`VEL`) is active instead, then this
value is used as the desired velocity.

If the robot is omnidirectional (not differential drive), then the same is done
for Y (`LATVEL` commands velocity in Y.  There is no command in the Pioneer
protocol for relative distance on Y.) 

If an absolute heading command (`HEAD`) is active, then a rotational
velocity proportional to the difference from the current heading is used.
If the robot has already rotated to the commanded heading however, then 
no rotational velocity is desired.  The desired velocity will later be limited according
to maximum speed configured.

Relative heading commands (`DHEAD`) 
are converted to absolute heading commands when recieved
based on the robot's current heading at the time the command is received.

If a rotational velocity command (`RVEL`) is active instead, then this value
is used as the desired rotational velocity.

Next, all desired speeds as specified or calculated above are limited
by maximum upper limit parameters.  These are set separately by software
clients using `SETV` and `SETRV` commands (or initial defaults specified in the model
definitions in `PioneerRobotModels.world.inc`.)

Next, acceleration and deceleration parameters are used to ramp the robot's 
current velocities up or down towards the desired velocities.  Acceleration
and decelaration parametrs are set separately by clients using
`SETA` and `SETRA` commands (or initial defaults from the model definitions are
used).  (A client may also specify a temporary override deceleration value via the
`ESTOP`/`QSTOP` commands. Deceleration is then reset back to the previous value
once the robot has stopped.)   If accelerating, the new velocity is incremented
by acceleration * dt, where dt is the time elapsed since the last 
update of the position model in the previous simulation loop iteration: we
assume that the next simulation iteration will be within a similar time
interval.  If decelerating, velocity is decreased.   If the desired velicity is within a
threshold of the current velocity, then the desired velocity is simply used.


The above process can be logged for debugging by switching the definitions of 
some macros in the `model_position.c` source code and recompiling, though note
that this will generate a lot of output. 

Next, a collision test is performed for the new position of the robot. If any part of
the robot shape (including the shapes of any other attached sensor models, such
as laser rangefinder) will collide with the environment or any other robot or
model, then the robot is not moved to the new position, so motion is effectively
stopped immediately.  The collision state is 
indicated to client software via the "stall" flag. 

As the robot moves, an updated virtual odometric pose within a global cartesian 
coordinate frame is also calculated, with error artificially introduced.   This is provided to
client software as its odometric pose estimate.   

Only position, velocity and acceleration of the robot as a whole
is simulated.  Other aspects of the robot's motion such as momentum
or inertia are not simulated, nor are component parts such as wheels,
nor the robot's interaction with the world other than collision detection.

The updated pose estimate is calcualed by projecting 
the robot along its current basic trajectory (velocities) from the previous pose
estimate, plus some error.  (The pose is initialized to
(0,0,0) when the simulated robot is created.)

    mx = (vx * dt) * (1 + error.x)
    my = (vy * dt) * (1 + error.y)
    mth = (vth * dt) * (1 + errror.th)  
    pose.x += mx * cos(th) - my * sin(th)
    pose.y += mx * sin(th) + my * cos(th)
    pose.th += mth 

vx, vy, vth are the robot's current velocity in its local X and Y axes, and
rotational velocity.  Th is the robot's current heading (in global pose coordinate frame).   
Note that on differential drive robots, vy is always 0 since it cannot directly
move along its Y axis, but may be nonzero on robots capable of lateral motion.

In MobileSim 0.6.x, error values of 0.0075 for error.x and error.y and 0.0075 for error.th are used by
default for all robots, except for "p3dx\_noerr" where no error is used.
Starting in MobileSim 0.9.x, there are several choices for calculating error, 
which can be selected via the --odom-error-mode command-line argument.
`random_each_update` is the default (as was errorneously documented previously.)

* `random_init`   Choose random values within a configured range at startup; each new robot will have different amount of error, even if same type.
* `random_each_update`  Chose random values within configured range at each simulation iteration.
* `constant`  Constant values, configured for each robot type.
* `none`  Use 0 for error values.

The error ranges are specified in the robot model definitions
(`PioneerRobotModels.world.inc`) and new custom model definitions may specify
error ranges that override defaults. (See Model Definitions below.) 
The `odom_error_range_x`, `odom_error_range_y`, and `odom_error_range_a`
properties specify ranges for error in each axis.  Alternatively, an
`odom_error` property can be used for constant error (if `constant` mode) 
or for symetric positive/negative error values (random modes) (this is for compatibilty).
(Units are meters and radians.)  The actual error values being used can be 
obtained by client software via the SIMSTAT packet (see below).

MobileSim can also calculate a simulated GPS position. 
This is calculated using the georeference position of the map file, and the
simulated robot's position in the map (true position, not pose estimate.)
A map must have a georeference point (`OriginLatLongAlt`) for this to work.
The latitude and longitude are provided in the `SIMSTAT` packet.
Some robot models have a GPS receiver position defined, when the corresponding
real robot has a standard mounting location for the GPS receiver or antenna.
If not, the center of the robot is assumed.  Note that ARIA also has a GPS
receiver location parameter in its robot parameter files.    Some software
(such as MOGS) use this to offset GPS positions it receives from both
a real GPS and the simulator.


#### laser model


The laser model represents a simplified scanning rangefinder sensor.  The position of 
the simulated laser in the world is relative to the position of the robot
position model and the simulated laser data is updated after the robot has
moved.

The code implementing the laser model can be found in the MobileSim source
code in `stage/src/model_laser.c`.

A scanning rangefinder measures distance ranges at fixed
degree intervales over its field of view.   
At each simulation loop iteration, each of these range values is deterimed
by a raycasting algorithm to search the simulation environment at that time.
The field of view of the sensor is divided by the number of range samples that wil be taken
to determine the angle of each sample.  A small amount of static random error
is added to each sample's angle, and then for each sample ray,
the environment quadtree is searched along until another object is located, or
the maximum distance capable is reached. Then 
the intersaction point between the ray and the shape of that object is
calculated, and the distance between the center of the laser rangefinder
model and that point is calculated.  Finally, a small amount of random error is
added to that range value.

A laser may be mounted upside down, in which case the order of
readings is reversed.

Objects in the environment may be flagged as invisible to laser sensors, in
which case they are ignored.

If the detected object has been configured with a special "reflectance" value,
then this is stored with the range value, optionally modified by configurable
rules (e.g. distance, angle of incidence, etc.)  This simulates the capability of the
SICK LMS-200 and some other lasers to differentiate special refelctor material
applied to objects.

A range error of +/- 5 mm and angular error of +/- 0.04 degrees is used for simulated LMS-200.  
A range error of +/- 7.5mm and angular error of +/- 0.04 degrees is used for
LMS-100. A range error of +/- 6mm and agular error of +/- 0.04 degrees is used
for S300.

If client software has requested laser data, then at each interval of client
communications, the most recently calculated set of laser range data is sent to
the client. 

#### ranger model (used for sonar)


The "ranger" model is used to simulate sets of individual, relatively short
range distance sensors, such as sonar and IR range sensors.  It differs
from the "laser" model in that the positions and orientations of each individual
sensor transciever can be configured separately.

The code implementing the ranger model can be found in the MobileSim source
code in `stage/src/model_ranger.c`.

In the simplest, default mode, for each configured sensor transciever, a raycasting algorithm is used to search the
environment from the center of the sensor's field of view, within the minimum
and maximum configured range.    This distance is stored as the range data. 

In the alternative "closest ray" mode, several raycasts are made within the field of view of the
sensor transciever, and the shortest range is used.  This mode is not used by
default.

Finally, some random error may be added to the range value.  +/- 0.5 mm is used,
since sonar is generally stable, if not as accurate as the laser in most
conditions.

Objects in the environment may be flagged as invisible to laser sensors, in
which case they are ignored.

No special timing, acoustic, reflection, or other factors are currently simulated.

                          crashes (Linux only).

`--lite-graphics`         Disable some graphics for slightly better performance

`--no-graphics`           Disable all graphics drawing for slightly better performance

`--html`                  Print log messages and other output in HTML rather than plain text

`--cwd` *dir*             Change directory to *dir* at startup.  Client programs can then load maps relative to this directory.

`--log-file` *file*       Print log messages to *file* instead of standard error console.

`-l` *file*               Same as `--log-file` *file*.

`--log-file-max-size`     If the amoount of data written to the log file exceeds *size*
*size*                    bytes, then rotate the log files (up to 5) and open a new log file.
                          This option keeps the total size of all the log files under *size**5 bytes.
                          If --noninteractive is given, the default for *size* is 5 MB. Otherwise,
                          the default is not to limit the size of the log file at all.

`--update-interval` *ms*  Time between each simulation update step.  (Default is 100 ms.
                          less may improve simulation performance but impact client responsiveness
                          and data update.)

`--update-sim-time` *ms*  How much simulated time each simulation update takes
                          (Default is equal to update-intenval. More than update-interval results in
                          faster-than-realtime simulation, which may cause problems
                          for clients)

`--start` *x*,*y*,*th*    Use *x*, *y*, *th* as robot starting point (even if the map has Home objects).

`--start outside`         Start robots 2m outside the map bounds -- it later must be moved to within the map bounds to be used.

`--start random`          Randomly choose a starting place within the map bounds.

`--resolution` *r*        Use resolution *r* (milimeters) for collisions and sensors. Default is 20mm (2cm)

`--ignore-command`        Ignore the command whose number is given. Refer to robot manual and MobileSim
*num*                     documentation for command numbers. 
                          For example, to prevent client programs from moving the robot's true position
                          with the ``SIM_SET_POSE`` command, number 224, use `--ignore-command 224`.
                          May be repeated. Warning: MobileSim and/or your
                          program may not function correctly if some critical commands are ignored.

`--less-verbose`          Be a bit less verbose about logging messages, especially things that might be
                          frequently logged (such as unsupported commands), to avoid filling up log files
                          with useless info.

`--log-timing-stats`      Log some simulation timing information every 30 seconds.
 
`--bind-to-address`       Only listen on the network interface with IP address *address* for new
*address*                 client connections (default is to listen on all addresses). This lets you run
                          more than one MobileSim process on the same TCP ports on a machine that has more 
                          than one network interface.

`--disable-crash-handler` Disable the GDB crash handler (and just abort program on fatal signals). No
                          effect on Windows, where there is no crash handler.
--------------------      ----------------------------------------------------------

Note: Windows' command shell unfortunately does not display the standard console output of GUI programs like MobileSim. 
To see MobileSim's output, you can either use the `--log-file`
option to log to a file, or run MobileSim from another command shell, such as the <a
href="http://www.mingw.org">MSYS</a> shell
(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435&package_id=82721&release_id=158803">download
MSYS here</a>).

#### Model Definitions

The standard Pioneer robot model definitions are in the file
`PioneerRobotModels.world.inc`, which is installed with MobileSim
(by default, in `/usr/local/MobileSim` on Linux and `C:\Program
Files\MobileRobots\MobileSim` on Windows).  This file is used to create the desired
robot model when loading a MobileRobots/ActivMedia .map file, and you may include
it in your custom Stage worlds as well.  It must be present to run MobileSim. To define modified or custom 
robot model definitions, either modify this file, or create one of these
directories:

* `~/.MobileSim/include/` if on Linux (where ~ is your home directory), or
* `C:\Documents and Settings\*<Your User Name>*\MobileSim\include` on Windows XP (Where *<Your User Name>* is your user account name.), or
* `C:\Users\*<Your User Name>*\MobileSim\include` on Windows 7+ (Where *<Your User Name>* is your user account name.), or

Any files MobileSim
finds in this include directory (except files that begin with a dot ".") 
are included into the world configuration after PioneerRobotModels.world.inc. 
(You can also put Stage world and GUI settings, and even model instantiations 
into these files as well. See the 
<a href="http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/doc/stage-2.0.0/group__model.html">
Stage documentation 
</a>
for complete documentation of the syntax of these files.)
New model definitions from these files can be used with the -r option on the command line using the model
definition name, or by typing the name into the Robot Model field
of MobileSim's initial dialog box.

When you define a new model, you can change the
`pioneer_robot_subtype`
property; 
this is the robot subtype string that ARIA uses 
to load client-side parameters for the robot. If you do change this value,
you must also create a parameter file (.p file) for that new type in ARIA's 'params' directory.

MobileSim expects common resources like the
`PioneerRobotModels.world.inc` file to
be in the standard installation location (`/usr/local/MobileSim` on Linux;
`C:\Program Files\MobileRobots\MobileSim` on Windows) unless an
environment
variable named `MOBILESIM` is set, or on Windows, in the 
`\SOFTWARE\MobileRobots\MobileSim\Install Directory` registry key.
Change these if you want MobileSim
to use resources in a different directory than the standard installation
location.

<h5>Robot speed limits</h5>

Model definitions for robots ("position" models) have speed limits defined. 
This is analogous to the limits set in a real robot's firmware.

#### Stage Worldfile Override

Instead of using a map file and the model definitions in
`PioneerRobotModels.world.inc` and the files in
`~/.MobileSim/include`, you may also simply provide a Stage-format 
world file with the -W or -stageworld command 
line options.   If provided, MobileSim uses only this world file for world
configuration, it does not use the common
`PioneerRobotModels.world.inc`,
<em>or</em>
the files in your "include" directory. 

#### Special Simulator Obstacles Objects


MobileSim includes some "box" model definitions in its model definitions file
`PioneerRobotModels.world.inc`. These are 0.5 x 0.5 meter objects that
you can place anywhere in the map, and move with the mouse during the
simulation. These boxes are created in the same way as robots, using the
`-r` command line argument. Use the `--start` option to
choose their locations. You can <a href="#modeldefs">create your own model
definitions</a> based on the
`box` model type as well (e.g. with different dimensions, color,
etc.)
MobileSim's predefined `box` model types are described below:

<dl>
  <dt>`box`
    <dd>A 0.5 x 0.5 m yellow box that is an obstacle which can also be sensed by laser and sonar.</dd>
  <dt>`box-nolaser`
    <dd>A 0.5 x 0.5 m yellow box that is an obstacle which can be sensed by sonar, but <em>not</em> lasers.</dd>
  <dt>`box-nolaser-nosonar`
    <dd>A 0.5 x 0.5 m yellow box that is an obstacle which can <em>not</em> be sensed by sonar or lasers (the robot will collide with it and trigger bumpers and stall).</dd>
  <dt>`box-reflector`
    <dd>A 0.5 x 0.5 m yellow box that is an obstacle which can be sensed by sonar, and
by laser with a high reflectance value (2).</dd>
</dl>

For example, you can create a simulation with two movable boxes and a Pioneer 3-DX robot with the
following command:
    MobileSim -r p3dx -r box -r box

You can also define custom map object types in a map file, which will allow you
to add them to that map file using Mapper3. MobileSim
recognizes some additional attributes of the custom types in order to create 
extra objects in the simulation. 


<dl>
  <dt>`Sim.Obstacle=`*yes|no*</dt>   
                    <dd>If this attribute is given to a `SectorType`,
                    then MobileSim creates an extra movable box. (Not supported
                    yet for `BoundaryType`)
                    If the value is `yes`, then the object will
                    be an obstacle that the robot will collide with. If
                    `no`, then the robot will pass through it.
                    This attribute controls whether a box is created or not, it
must be given with either a yes or no value.
                    </dd>

  <dt>`Sim.LaserReflect=`*int*</dt>
                    <dd>If the
                    *int* value is greater than 1, then it
                    will be returned to the client with laser readings, if the 
                    laser sensor model is able to detect it according to its
                    rules for detecting reflectors.
                    (See `Reflector` below).</dd>
                    If 1, it will be detected as a normal object by the laser.
                    If 0, it will not be detected by the laser at all.
                    </dd>
  <dt>`Sim.SonarReflect=`*yes|no*</dt>
                    <dd>If `yes`, then the object will be detected by 
                    sonar. If `no`, then it will not be detected by
                    sonar.`</dd>
  
</dl>


<dl>
  <dt>`Reflector`</dt>         
                    <dd>This creates a line in the map that has a higher
                    "reflectance" value than the normal LINES data. (Note, 
                    ARIA version 2.5 or later is needed to be able to read the reflectance 
                    value data from the simulater LRF). Both sides of the line
                    will have high reflectance.</dd>
</dl>

To add these custom object type definitions to a map file, first manually edit
the map to define a custom type that has a simulator specific attribute.
For example, the following defines five object types: 
* a normal box
* a highly reflective box
* an box that is invisible to laser and sonar but which the robot will
collide with
* a box that is invisible to laser and sonar and which the robot will not
collide with  (it is simply visible in the simulator, this is useful as a simple
marker of a place in the map)
* a reflector line

    MapInfo: SectorType Name=BoxObstacle Label=Sim_BoxObstacle Sim.Obstacle=yes
    MapInfo: SectorType Name=ReflectiveBoxObstacle Label=Sim_ReflectiveBoxObstacle Sim.Obstacle=yes Sim.LaserReflect=32
    MapInfo: SectorType Name=InvisibleBox Label=Sim_InvisibleBox Shape=Plain Sim.Obstacle=yes Sim.LaserReflect=0 Sim.SonarReflect=no
    MapInfo: SectorType Name=MarkerBox Label=Sim_MarkerBox Shape=Plain Sim.Obstacle=no Sim.LaserReflect=0 Sim.SonarReflect=no
    MapInfo: BoundaryType Name=Reflector Label=Reflector Desc=Reflector "Color0=0xFF00FF"

You can also add attributes such as `Shape`, `Desc`,
`Color0` and `Color1`.  To include spaces in the
`Desc` or
`Label` attributes, surround the whole key=value part in quotes (e.g.
`"Desc=Invisible Box for Simulator"`).

Once these definitions are added to a map file which is then loaded into 
Mapper3, then Mapper3 makes them available: in the Boundary tools for 
Reflector lines, and the Sector tools for boxes.  You can modify the Color 
and Shape parameters if you would like them to be displayed differently in 
Mapper3.  When instances of the objects are added with Mapper3 they are then
added to the map file as "Cairn" map objects (similar to goals etc.).

#### Special Sectors in Map File

MobileSim will recognize certain special sectors if they appear in
the map file.  Mapper3 does not recognize all of these by default, but
if you add the appropriate `MapInfo` lines to the map with a text editor (see
below), they will appear in the "Advanced Areas" menu of Mapper3.

* `BadGPSSector` and `SimBadGPSSector`:  If a map has a GPS georeference point
  (`OriginLatLongAlt`), then MobileSim will provide simulated latitude and
  longitude in the `SIMSTAT` packet (see description of `SIMSTAT` below.)  
  If the robot is inside a `BadGPSSector` or `SimBadGPSSector`, then the value 
  provided in `SIMSTAT` for the "good GPS" field will be 0.  Otherwise it will be 100.
  `ArSimulatedGPS` in ARIA will use this to indicate either "NoFix" (if -1), or "SimulatedFix" (if 100) or
  "BadFix" (0) fix type and ideal (1.0) or bad (0.0) DOP value. MOGS uses
  `BadGPSSector` to prevent intermittent or inconsistent GPS positions from
  reducing navigation quality while in areas that have been marked as "known-bad"
  areas of GPS coverage. 

To enable the creation of BadGPSSector and SimBadGPSSector in Mapper3, 
use a text editor to add the following lines to the map file:

    MapInfo: SectorType "Name=BadGPSSector" "Label=BadGPS" "Desc=Area where GPS is known to be unreliable" "Color0=0x888888" "Color1=0xbea4ce"
    MapInfo: SectorType "Name=SimBadGPSSector" "Label=SimBadGPS" "Desc=Area where GPS will be made unreliable in MobileSim" "Color0=0x779977" "Color1=0xbea4ce"



#### Default Map File

If you find that you are often loading the same map file into MobileSim
over and over again, you can save a step by copying that map file into
`~/.MobileSim` (Linux) or `\Documents and Settings\*<User
Name>*\MobileSim`
(Windows) and naming it `init.map`.  If this map file exists, MobileSim
will load this map at startup if no command-line option is given, rather
than dislpaying the initial Load Map File dialog box.

#### Exit Codes

The MobileSim process has the following exit codes:

---------------   ------------------------------------------------
      0           No error      
      255 (-1)    Error in command line arguments      
      254 (-2)    Error writing a temporary file on startup      
      253 (-3)    Error loading a map file      
      252 (-4)    Error initializing Stage      
      250 (-6)    Error loading a robot parameters file (.p file) to define a robot model      
      249 (-7)    Error initializing the Pioneer emulation
thread
      248 (-8)    Error opening a TCP socket for a robot or factory      
      236 (-20)   MobileSim crashed, but crash handler caught signal and logged information to log file.     
---------------   --------------------------------------------------     

Error codes may also be requested in the `SIM_EXIT` command by a client (use 
positive error codes less than 127, to differentiate from possible MobileSim codes).



Robot Protocol Support
----------------------

Currently the following parts of the ARCOS/AROS/P2OS/AmigOS/PSOS protocols are 
supported. This covers all robot motion commands used by ARIA (including both
direct motion requests and actions), and several other features.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Name           Command #   Argument    Description
                           Type

-------------  ----------  ----------  ----------------------------------------------------  


#### Simulator-only commands

For compatability with SRISim and old ARIA versions, equivalent commands 
with deprecated ID numbers are also accepted, with a warning.

MobileSim will always use the robot name "MobileSim".  It will also report
an OS version number starting with "S." and the string "SIM"
for serial number in the CONFIGpac packet, and respond to the `SIM_STAT` 
command with a `SIMSTATpac` packet and the `SIM_CTRL,6` command with a `SIM_INFO` 
packet. You can use these values in client software
to detect whether it is connected to MobileSim or not.

  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Name                    Command Argument       Description
                                Type 
-------------           ------- -------------- -------------------------------
`SIM_SET_POSE`          224     int4,int4,int4 Move robot to global pose in simulator (does not change odometry).
                                               The parameters are 4-byte integers for X, Y and Theta. The packet's argument
                                               type byte is ignored. Here is an example of how to send this command in ARIA,
                                               where `robot` is an `ArRobot` object, and
                                               `x`, `y` and `th` are `int`
                                               variables containing desired position in milimeters and degrees:
                                                 ArRobotPacket pkt;
                                                 pkt.setID(ArCommands::SIM_SET_POSE);
                                                 pkt.uByteToBuf(0); // argument type: ignored.
                                                 pkt.byte4ToBuf(x);
                                                 pkt.byte4ToBuf(y);
                                                 pkt.byte4ToBuf(th);
                                                 pkt.finalizePacket();
                                                 robot.getDeviceConnection()->write(pkt.getBuf(), pkt.getLength());

`SIM_RESET`             225     none           Move robot to original starting position in simulator (e.g. Home point or Dock) and reset odometry to 0,0,0.

`SIM_LRF_ENABLE`        230     int            1 to enable simulated laser rangefinder in-band (data packet ID=0x60).  2 to enable simulated LRF with extended information (data packet ID=0x61).  0 to disable LRF.  See below for data packet formats.
  
`SIM_LRF_SET_FOV_START` 231     int            Set start angle of laser field of view
  
`SIM_LRF_SET_FOV_END`   232     int            Set end angle of laser field of view Currently start and end must be symetrical around 0. ARIA always does this, but if you want configure it differently it won't work.

1     Replace  Remove existing map data and load a new map from the
      map      file given as a length-prefixed string folowing the 
               operation code. Note: If the path is not absolute,
               it will be interpreted as relative to MobileSim's 
               startup working directory, or the directory given
               with the --cwd command-line argument.
               For compatibility with Windows and other platforms with
               case-insensitive file naming, the case of the file name
               does not matter.

Here is an example of a packet handler function for ARIA that extracts some data from the
SIMSTAT packet. Wrap this function in an `ArFunctor` object and use
`ArRobot::addPacketHandler()` to register it with an
`ArRobot` object.

    bool handleSimStatPacket(ArRobotPacket* pkt)
    {
       if(pkt->getID() != 0x62) return false; // SIMSTAT has id 0x62
       printf("SIMSTAT pkt received:\n"    );
       char a = pkt->bufToByte();  // unused byte
       char b = pkt->bufToByte();  // unused byte
       ArTypes::UByte4 flags = pkt->bufToUByte4();
       printf("\tFlags=0x%x\n", flags);
       int simint = pkt->bufToUByte2();
       int realint = pkt->bufToUByte2();
       int lastint = pkt->bufToUByte2();
       printf("\tSimInterval=%d, RealInterval=%d, LastInterval=%d.\n", simint, realint, lastint);
       int realX = pkt->bufToByte4();
       int realY = pkt->bufToByte4();
       int realZ = pkt->bufToByte4();
       int realTh = pkt->bufToByte4();
       printf("\tTrue Pose = (%d, %d, %d, %d)\n", realX, realY, realZ, realTh);
       if(flags & ArUtil::BIT1)
       {
          double lat = pkt->bufToByte4()/10e6;
          double lon = pkt->bufToByte4()/10e6;
          double alt = pkt->bufToByte4()/100;
          double qual = pkt->bufToByte()/100;
          printf("\tLatitude = %f deg., Longitude = %f deg., Altitude = %f m, Quality = %f%%\n", lat, lon, alt, qual);
       }
       else
       {
          puts("No geoposition.");
       }
       return true;
    }
When connected to MobileSim and using ArGPSConnector, ARIA will create an
ArSimulatedGPS object to read the simulated GPS data.



The `SIMINFO` packet is as follows.
New fields may be added in future versions.

	Packet ID                ubyte=0x63 (100)
	Application name         NULL-terminated string     Name of simulator
	Application version      NULL-terminated string     Version of simulator
	Flags                    4ubyte                     Bit 0=Sim is interactive with user and has a GUI; Bit 1=Sim crashed last time but was automatically restarted.     
	Num. Devices             4ubyte                     Number of devices attached to the robot
	For each device:
	  Device Name            string                      Unique name for this device
	  Device Type             string                     e.g. "laser"
	  Device Number           ubyte                      To distinguish individual devices of the same type
	  Device Status           ubyte,ubyte,ubyte,ubyte    Device-dependent status code(s)
	...
   

The `SIM_MAP_CHANGED` packet is as follows.  This packet is sent to all
connected clients if the map is changed or reloaded for any reason.
New fields may be added in future versions.

	Packet ID                ubyte=0x66 (102)
	User                     ubyte. 1=Map was loaded by user command (e.g. via gui), 0=Map was loaded by client program SIM_CTRL command.
	Loaded                   ubyte. 1=A new map was really loaded.  0=Map was not reloaded because already loaded and file is unchanged since last load.
	Filename                 string. filename of map that was loaded.
 
#### Unsupported commands

The following commands are not supported, and will be ignored, with a warning
message. Some are not applicable to the simulator (ENCODER) or pertain to
devices that aren't implemented in the simulator yet (gripper, sounds).

	ENCODER        19
	POLLING        3
	SAY            15
	JOYINFO        17
	DIGOUT         30
	GRIPPER        33
	ADSEL          35
	GRIPPERVAL     36
	GRIPPERPACREQUEST 37
	IOREQUEST      40
	PTUPOS         41
	GETAUX         43
	TCM2           45
	JOYDRIVE       47
	HOSTBAUD       50
	AUX1BAUD       51
	AUX2BAUD       52
	GYRO           58
	CALCOMP        65
	TTY3           66
	GETAUX2        67
	SOUND          90
	PLAYLIST       91
	SOUNDTOG       92
	OLD_LOADWORLD  63
	OLD_LOADPARAM  61
	OLD_STEP       64


The following commands will probably never be supported since they do nothing on
modern robots or use is discouraged:

	DROTATE        14
	DCHEAD         22
	KICK           34

These commands are supported for compatability with a previous simulator

	OLD_LRF_ENABLE     35   int    Start/stop sending laser data in-band 
	OLD_LRF_PARMSTART  36   int    Sets start angle 0-180 degrees; also disables laser; with #37, determines "flipped" order of readings.
	OLD_LRF_PARMEND    37   int    Sets scan end angle; also disables laser; with #36, determines "flipped" order of readings.
	OLD_LRF_PARMINC    38   int    Sets inter-sample angle (100ths of degree)


The following commands are normally disabled, but can be re-enabled with the
`--srisim-compat` command-line argument: 

	OLD_END_SIM        62          none        Exit simulator (MobileSim exits completely). Note, this command is also used for another use on real robots and newer version of ARIA send it after connecting (so the simulator exits immediately).  You can enable the other SRISim compatability commands with `--srisim-compat`, but disable this command using `--ignore-command 62`
	OLD_SETORIGINX     66          int         Set the robot's current true X, (Note, conflicts with TTY3 command)
	OLD_SETORIGINY     67          int         ...Y
	OLD_SETORIGINTH     68         int         ...Theta
	OLD_RESET_TO_ORIGIN     69     none        Reset true X Y, TH to 0,0,0
